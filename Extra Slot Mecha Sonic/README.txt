Hello, if your reading this then you have access to ES Mecha Sonic MK.II (obviously).
Remember to please not distribute this mod to other people outside of the OFFICIAL Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited discord server.
You can make any mod for ES Mecha (new palletes, signpost mod, script mod, compability with the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 3 AIR, etc), dont forget to link the original mod, wait for the mod itself to come out and/or credit me. 
You are allowed to use any script of this mod as long as proper credit is given and it is not used for any commercial purpose. However, ask permission to any artist involved in this mod permission to use their sprites.
Any bug report, feedback or something else? @ me on the discord server.
